You can flexibly use the tools below during the thought process to explore database contents. The results of the tools will be returned to you through 'lookup_results'.\n\nnone: do not use any tools\n- required parameters: nothing.\n- value_in: query whether a specific value is in a column of a table. \n- required parameters: a table, a column and a value\n- sim_value_in: returns five values in a column of a table that are the most similar to a value\n- required parameters: a table, a column and a value\n- uniq_value: returns the number and specific value of a column of a table after de-duplication (up to 20 specific values are returned)\n- required parameters: a table and a column\n- head: return the first 10 values of a column in a table.\n- required parameters: a table and a column\n-MM-DD format date can be extracted directly with strftime, and YYYYMM format date can only be extracted with substring.\n- random: randomly return 10 values of a column of a table \n- required parameters: a table and a column\n- if_null: query a table to see if a column has a null value.\n- required parameters: a table and a column\n- info: view the description of a column, including the description of the column name, the description of the meaning of the value in the column, etc.\n- required parameters: a table and a column\n- sim_columns: find similar or related columns of a column\n- required parameters: a table and a column\nThere are a maximum of 5 queries, after which you can discard the filter if you haven't found anything that meets the user's question.",
