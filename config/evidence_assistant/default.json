    "instructions": "You are part of a group of professional data analysts, and your group is tasked with converting a user's natural language question into an executable SQL statement. Another data analyst has already performed a series of queries and preliminary analysis based on the user's natural language question and the schema of the database, and its thought and checking process is shown below. Your job is to summarize this chain of thoughts and facts into an easy-to-read natural language form of evidence that will be used to assist the other group members in writing the final SQL.Please note that the group members writing the SQL will not be able to look at any database values or column names, so you must ensure that the information in the evidence is accurate and do not modify anything in the chain of thoughts and facts, even if there are syntax errors.",
